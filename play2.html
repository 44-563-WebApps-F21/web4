    <h6 class="LORD_ILLINGWORTH name">LORD ILLINGWORTH</h6> <p class="LORD_ILLINGWORTH speech">Thoroughly sensible woman, your mother, Gerald.  I
        knew she would come round in the end.</p>
    <h6 class="GERALD name">GERALD</h6> <p class="GERALD speech"> My mother is awfully conscientious, Lord Illingworth, and I know
        she doesn’t think I am educated enough to be your secretary.  She is
        perfectly right, too.  I was fearfully idle when I was at school, and I
        couldn’t pass an examination now to save my life.</p>
    <h6 class="LORD_ILLINGWORTH name">LORD ILLINGWORTH</h6> <p class="LORD_ILLINGWORTH speech">My dear Gerald, examinations are of no value
        whatsoever.  If a man is a gentleman, he knows quite enough, and if he is
        not a gentleman, whatever he knows is bad for him.</p>
