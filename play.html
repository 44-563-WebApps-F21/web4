    <h2>A Woman of no Importance</h2>
    <h3>ACT III.The Hall at Hunstanton Chase.</h3>
    <h6 class="LORD_ILLINGWORTH name">LORD ILLINGWORTH</h6> <p class="LORD_ILLINGWORTH speech">Thoroughly sensible woman, your mother, Gerald.  I
        knew she would come round in the end.</p>
    <h6 class="GERALD name">GERALD</h6> <p class="GERALD speech"> My mother is awfully conscientious, Lord Illingworth, and I know
    she doesn’t think I am educated enough to be your secretary.  She is
    perfectly right, too.  I was fearfully idle when I was at school, and I
    couldn’t pass an examination now to save my life.</p>
    <h6 class="LORD_ILLINGWORTH name">LORD ILLINGWORTH</h6> <p class="LORD_ILLINGWORTH speech">My dear Gerald, examinations are of no value
        whatsoever.  If a man is a gentleman, he knows quite enough, and if he is
        not a gentleman, whatever he knows is bad for him.</p>
    <h6 class="GERALD name">GERALD</h6> <p class="GERALD speech">But I am so ignorant of the world, Lord Illingworth.</p>
    <h6 class="LORD_ILLINGWORTH name">LORD ILLINGWORTH</h6> <p class="LORD_ILLINGWORTH speech">Don’t be afraid, Gerald.  Remember that you’ve got on
        your side the most wonderful thing in the world—youth!  There is nothing
        like youth.  The middle-aged are mortgaged to Life.  The old are in
        life’s lumber-room.  But youth is the Lord of Life.  Youth has a kingdom
        waiting for it.  Every one is born a king, and most people die in exile,
        like most kings.  To win back my youth, Gerald, there is nothing I
        wouldn’t do—except take exercise, get up early, or be a useful member of
        the community.</p>
    <h6 class="GERALD name">GERALD</h6> <p class="GERALD speech"> But you don’t call yourself old, Lord Illingworth?</p>
    <h6 class="LORD_ILLINGWORTH name">LORD ILLINGWORTH</h6> <p class="LORD_ILLINGWORTH speech">I am old enough to be your father, Gerald.</p>
    <h6 class="GERALD name">GERALD</h6> <p class="GERALD speech">I don’t remember my father; he died years ago.</p>
    <h6 class="LORD_ILLINGWORTH name">LORD ILLINGWORTH</h6> <p class="LORD_ILLINGWORTH speech">So Lady Hunstanton told me.</p>
    <h6 class="GERALD name">GERALD</h6> <p class="GERALD speech"> It is very curious, my mother never talks to me about my father. I sometimes think she must have married beneath her.</p>
